  ## Data Sources

  Gather data from these sources:

  ### Git & Version Control
  ```bash
  # Get commits for date range
  git log --since="{{ week_start }}" --until="{{ week_end }}" --oneline

  # Get contributor stats
  git shortlog --since="{{ week_start }}" --until="{{ week_end }}" -sn

  # Get file changes
  git diff --stat --since="{{ week_start }}" --until="{{ week_end }}"
  ```

  ### GitHub/GitLab (if available)
  - Pull request activity via API or CLI (`gh pr list`)
  - Issue activity
  - Code review statistics
  - Deployment information

  ### CI/CD Systems
  - Build success/failure rates
  - Test results and coverage
  - Deployment frequency

  ### Monitoring & Observability
  - Incident logs
  - Error rates
  - Performance metrics
  - Uptime statistics

  ### Project Management Tools
  - Jira, Linear, or Asana tickets
  - Sprint progress
  - Velocity trends

  ## Output Format

  ### For Markdown:
  ```markdown
  # Weekly Engineering Report
  **Team:** {{ team }}
  **Week:** {{ week_start }} to {{ week_end }}

  ## Executive Summary
  [Summary paragraph]

  ## Key Achievements
  - **Feature:** Description [PR #123]

  ## Best Practices

  1. **Be Concise:** Focus on high-impact information
  2. **Be Specific:** Use numbers, links, concrete examples
  3. **Be Honest:** Don't hide problems or risks
  4. **Be Forward-Looking:** Include plans and next steps
  5. **Celebrate Wins:** Acknowledge team achievements
  6. **Highlight Blockers:** Make impediments visible
  7. **Use Consistent Format:** Makes reports easy to scan
  8. **Include Context:** Help readers understand the "why"

  ## Tips for Data Gathering

  - Start with git/GitHub CLI commands to get code activity
  - Use project management tool APIs for ticket data
  - Check monitoring dashboards for incident/uptime data
  - Review CI/CD dashboards for build/deployment stats
  - Ask team members for qualitative updates if needed
  - Keep track of recurring data sources for next time

  ## Notes

  - If data is unavailable, note it in the report
  - Focus on trends and changes, not just absolute numbers
  - Tailor detail level to your audience (exec vs team)
  - Include links so readers can drill down
  - Be consistent week-over-week for easy comparison

  Now proceed with gathering data and generating the weekly report for {{ team }} for the week of {{ week_start }} to {{ week_end }}.
